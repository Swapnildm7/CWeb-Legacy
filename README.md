# CWeb

This repo holds my C/C++ Web service code.

The main purpose of this repo:

- Learn C/C++ especially when applying OOP/Design pattern.
- Learn to use various hard-to-understand C/C++ syntax: pointers, template, etc...
- Learn & explore Linux system when connecting to database (because C/C++ is very near to Linux system, unlike Python, NodeJS, Ruby, ...).
- Applying/Implementing Cryptography papers (currently studying Symmetric Searchable Encryption).
